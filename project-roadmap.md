# Dungeon Adventure 2.0 Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Code Review
- [ ] Evaluate existing codebase
  - Review current implementation
  - Identify parts to keep/refactor/rebuild
  - Document technical debt
- [ ] Set up new project structure
  - Create directory hierarchy
  - Set up git repository
  - Configure .gitignore
  - Create requirements.txt

## Phase 2: Core Systems Design
- [ ] Character System Architecture
  - Design class hierarchy
  - Plan combat mechanics
  - Design monster stats system
- [ ] Database Design
  - Design SQLite schema
  - Plan save/load system
  - Design monster data storage
- [ ] Combat System Design
  - Design turn mechanics
  - Plan speed-based combat
  - Design special abilities

## Phase 3: Implementation Strategy
### Option A: Refactor Existing Code
- [ ] Move existing files to new structure
- [ ] Update import statements
- [ ] Refactor for new features
- [ ] Add new systems

### Option B: Fresh Implementation
- [ ] Keep existing code as reference
- [ ] Implement new base systems

# Key Decisions Needed
1. Rebuild vs Refactor:
   - Pros/cons of each approach
   - Impact on timeline
   - Technical debt considerations

2. GUI Framework:
   - Keep Tkinter vs switch
   - Timing of potential switch
   - Impact on development

3. Implementation Priority:
   - Which features first?
   - Critical path elements
   - Dependencies between systems
