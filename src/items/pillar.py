class Pillar(Item):
    """
    Represents a special collectible pillar in the game world.

    Pillars are unique items that play a crucial role in the
    Dungeon Adventure game's progression and narrative structure.
    They are collected throughout the dungeon exploration and
    are essential to completing the game's primary objective.

    Key Characteristics:
    1. Specialized Item Type
       - Inherits from base Item class
       - Provides specific pillar-related initialization

    2. Collection Mechanism
       - Tracked separately from other items
       - Critical to game completion

    3. Narrative Significance
       - Represents important game world elements
       - Suggests deeper game lore or mission

    Initialization Strategy:
    - Calls parent Item constructor
    - Provides default pillar-specific attributes
    - Supports potential future expansion

    Design Considerations:
    - Flexible item representation
    - Consistent with game's item system
    - Supports multiple pillar types

    Potential Future Enhancements:
    - Add unique pillar effects
    - Implement pillar-specific interactions
    - Create more detailed pillar descriptions

    Example Usage:
    ```python
    # Creating a pillar with specific characteristics
    pillar = Pillar(x=10, y=20, name="Wisdom", description="Ancient pillar of knowledge")
    ```
